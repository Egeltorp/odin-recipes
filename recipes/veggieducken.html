        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Today we're gonna be making Henry's f***ing Veggie Turducken, or as it is 
            commonly known as the Veggieducken. The Veggieducken was first conceived
            by Dan Pashman in late 2012, but it is still served today at 
            Thanksgiving feasts all over Los Angeles.</p>
            <p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Most vegetarians are very friendly, although you wanna be careful 
                not to give off a sense of being threatening or taunting in any way, 
                because they could go into what's called a fight or flight response mode 
                which could trigger them into <em>aggressive activity</em>. But buy and large you
                will find them to be a very friendly group.</p>

        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> a lot of times during the holidays we get so caught up
             in the joy and the happiness and the laughter and whatnot, <br>that we lose sight
             of the underlying reality that the world is a pretty shitty place.</p>
